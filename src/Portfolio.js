        <h1>Hi, I'm Nayana ðŸ‘‹</h1>
        <p>
            I am a Computer Science graduate from Newcastle University with a passion for 
            building full-stack applications and solving data-driven problems.
        </p>
        <p>
            I enjoy working at the intersection of web, cloud, and data â€” using Python, 
            FastAPI, React, and GCP to create scalable, impactful solutions.
        </p>
